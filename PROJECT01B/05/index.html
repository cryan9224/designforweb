 <p>Do you remember the first time you were<br> 
called annoying?<br>
How your breath stopped short in your chest<br>
the way the light drained from your eyes,<br> 
though you knew your cheeks were ablaze<br>
the way your throat tightened as you tried to <br>
form an argument that got lost on your tongue?<br>
Your eyes never left the floor that day.<br>
You were 13.<br>
you’re 20 now, and i still see the light fade from your eyes when you talk about your <br>
interests for “too long,”.<br>
apologies littering every other sentence,<br>
words trailing off a cliff you haven’t jumped from in 7 years.<br>
i could listen to you forever, though i know speaking for more than 3 uninterrupted <br>
minutes makes you anxious.<br>
all i want you to know is that you deserve to be heard<br>
for 3 minutes<br>
for 10 minutes<br>
for 2 hours<br>
forever.<br>
there will be people who cannot handle your grace, your beauty, your wisdom, your heart;<br>
mostly because they can’t handle their own. but you will never be<br>
and have never been<br>
“too much.”<br>
