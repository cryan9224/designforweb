 <p>Do you remember the first time you were called annoying?<br>
How your breath stopped short in your chest<br>
the way the light drained from your eyes, though you knew your cheeks were ablaze<br>
the way your throat tightened as you tried to form an argument that got lost on your tongue?<br>
Your eyes never left the floor that day.<br>
You were 13.<br>
