Do you remember the first time you were called<br> annoying?<br>
how your breath stopped short in your chest<br>
the way the light drained from your eyes,<br> Though<br> you knew your cheeks were ablaze<br>
the way your throat tightened as you tried to form<br> an argument that got lost on your tongue?<br>
your eyes never left the floor that day.<br>
you were 13.<br>

You’re 20 now, and I still see the light fade from your eyes when you talk about your interests for “too long,”<br>
apologies littering every other sentence,
words trailing off a cliff you haven’t jumped from in 7 years.<br>
I could listen to you forever, though I know speaking for more than 3 uninterrupted minutes makes you anxious.<br>
All I want you to know is that you deserve to be heard<br>
for 3 minutes<br>
for 10 minutes<br>
for 2 hours <br>
forever.<br>

There will be people who cannot handle your grace, your beauty, your wisdom, your heart;<br>
mostly because they can’t handle their own. But<br> you will never be<br>
and have never been<br>
“too much.”</p>
